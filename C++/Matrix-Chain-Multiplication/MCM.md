## Matrix Chain Multiplication
* Matrix chain multiplication is a optimization problem that to find the most efficient way to multiply given sequence of matrices.
* The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide the sequence of the matrix multiplication involved.
* The MCM.cpp on execution takes the number of matrices as first input and then dimensions of matrices as in the form (1x2 2x3 3x4) 1 2 3 4. And gives the optimal cost of multiplication as output.
* This problem can be solved using a DP algorithm as it used in MCM.cpp.
