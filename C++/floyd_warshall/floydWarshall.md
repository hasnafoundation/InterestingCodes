## Floyd Warshall Algorithm
* The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is used for calculating shortest path between all pairs of vertices.
* floydWarshall.cpp on execution takes an input as adjacency matrix so, it first takes the dimensions of the matrix as a input and then the adjacency matrix and outputs the matrix which represents shortest distances between every pair of vertices.
* It is a DP solution to the problem to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted graph.
