## Knapsack problem
* The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. 
* The knapsack.cpp program gives solution to this problem by using a DP algorithm.
* It takes the number of items as input, value and weight for each item and capacity of knapsack. Then it outputs the maximum value of knapsack possible.
